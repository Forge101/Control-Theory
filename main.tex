\section{Introduction}
This document will tackle the topic of analysing and controlling an electrical cart by use of theoretical models and practical experiments. This specific cart is driven by two electrical DC motors that are controlled by an arduino board which is mounted on the cart itself. On this cart is also a pendulum of which the angle can be measured by a sensor. A second sensor is mounted on the front of the cart and measures the distance. The angle of this sensor can be changed.\\

The goals of this task is the identification of the engines, the transferfunction, ...
